About PyBank Project

This is a simple project meant to illustrate the use of Python (without Numpy or Pandas) for analyzing the financial records of a fake company. Financial data is located in
the Resources file as [budget_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

Analysis of these records is limited to:

 * The total number of months included in the dataset

 * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

 * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

 * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

 * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Script will both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file (called "output" here) with the results.
