About PyBank Project

This is a simple project meant to illustrate the use of Python (without Numpy or Pandas) for analyzing mock election data, specifically its vote_counting process. Financial data is located in
the Resources file as [election_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.

Analysis includes:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.



Script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file ("Called results.txt here") with the results.
